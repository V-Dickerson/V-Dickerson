Hi! I'm a Computer Science student at Texas A&M minoring in statistics. I'm passionate about:
* 🖤 Software that **helps people** interact with the world more smoothly,
* 🤝 **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion** in STEM. Check out [O4U](https://www.outforundergrad.org/) and [oSTEM](https://ostem.org/?)!
  * You can find me at **O4U Digital** or **oSTEM National** conferences :) Reach out!
* 🤖 Machine Learning! It's the perfect intersection between software, statistics, and impact.

I look to develop software that I'm **passionate about**, either due to the **impacts it can have on the world** or the **lessons and skills** that I can gain from it.

Also, I'm more than just a software engineer 😊 I'm:
* 🗣️ Always trying to learn to be better at communication,
* ✊ Involved in **activism in my local community** and university, and
* Developing healthy habits and reinforcing them!
