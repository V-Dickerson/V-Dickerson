Hi! I'm a Computer Science student at Texas A&M minoring in statistics. I'm passionate about:
* 🖤 Software that **helps people** interface easier with the world,
* 🌐 **Open source** development practices, and
* 🤝 **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion** in STEM.

I look to develop software that I'm **passionate about**, either due to the **impacts it can have on the world** or the **lessons and skills** that I can gain from it.

Also, I'm more than just a software engineer 😊 I'm:
* 🎥 Into **niche and underrated movies & shows**,
* ✊ Involved in **activism in my local community** and university, and
* 🍳 Trying to figure out how to cook as a busy and occasionally lazy college student.
